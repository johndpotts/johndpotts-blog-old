Angular 6 brings with it some changes to Observables and Operators in RxJS(The Reactive Extensions library).


The version of RxJS required by Angular 6 is RxJS6; this version has some significant, potentially breaking changes from RxJS 5. 

**But wait** - before you get too stressed out, you should know up front that there is a simple way to ensure backward-compatibility. All you need to do is run the following line in terminal from your project directory:


```js
npm install --save rxjs-compat
```

This installs the rxjs-compat package, which will make your code automatically compatible with RxJS6. No other changes required! 


## What's Different
Now that the issue of backward compatibility is settled, let's move on to a look at what we need to start doing differently in Angular 6 when working with observables:

### File Structure
The first thing that should be mentioned about the update to RxJS6 is that the RxJS library has made a big change in file structure that will affect our import statements. Instead of importing Observable and Subject from subfolders within RxJS, we now import them directly:
```
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
```

##### becomes

```
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
```
The import path for operators has also changed. Operators are now stored in a common subfolder: the new import statements look like this:

```
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';
```

These file changes let us import smaller code segments, leading to reduced bundle sizes.


### Operator Name Changes

Another significant change in RxJS6 involves renaming a number of operators and observable creation methods. Because these are getting called differently, names that conflicted with reserved JS words had to be changed. So `do()` is now `tap()`, and `finally()` is now `finalize()`.

Here is the complete list of name changes:
```js
// old name
throw()
// new name
throwError()

// old name
fromPromise()
// new name
from()

// old name
catch()
// new name
catchError()

// old name
do()
// new name
tap()

// old name
finally()
// new name
finalize()

// old name
switch()
// new name
switchAll()
```

### Using Operators

The name changes were a result of a change in the way operators are used in RxJS. Here's how operators were used prior to RxJS6:

```js
observable
  .do(logger.log(x))
  .map(x => x - 5 )
  .subscribe(x => {
    doSomething(x);
  });
```

Instead of being called directly on the observable, the methods are called as arguments inside a .pipe() function. The methods are called in the order they are listed.

```js
observable
  .pipe(
    tap(logger.log(x)),
    map(x => x - 5 )
  )
  .subscribe(x => {
    doSomething(x);
  });
  ```

Nothing too complicated to implement - and remember, backward compatibility is a breeze!
